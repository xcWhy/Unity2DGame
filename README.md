# Unity2DGame
Following @Pandemonium tutorials on Youtube, I created a simple Unity Game :)

To run the game, users will need to get from unity marketplace the models for the hero - ["Dragon Warrior"](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/dragon-warrior-free-93896)

And for the background - ["Pixel Adventure 1"](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/pixel-adventure-1-155360)

You will need to put together the terraing manually T-T

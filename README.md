# Unity2DGame
Following @Pandemonium tutorials on Youtube, I created a simple Unity Game :)

To run the game, users will need to get from unity marketplace the models for the hero - "Dragon Warrior"
And for the background - "Pixel Adventure 1"

You will need to put together the terraing manually T-T
